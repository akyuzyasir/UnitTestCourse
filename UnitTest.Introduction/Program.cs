// Unit Testing : Unit in Unit Testing is the smallest part of a system that can be tested. Used to check whether a method works or not. And guarantees that our methods are working. Helps us find where and why errors occur in an app.
// Integration Testing : Testing parts of a system that interacts with other parts
// System Testing : Testing the whole system
// Acceptance Testing : Testing the whole system by real test users.

// Why do we need Unit Testing?

// We need to be sure that functionalities works as we intended
// Test Driven Design.
// Improves our code quality ( bug-fix loop, reusability, DI)
// Unit tests improves our refactoring speed as we identify the problematic functions.

// How to write Unit Tests

/*
        * The smallest parts are determined.
        * Create a testing scenario
        * Name the unit test
        * A Unit Test must be able to run independently.
        * Run quickly and produce results quickly
        * Error results must be understandable and must be instructive

/*
    * Unit of Work
    * Unit Test
    * Assert
    * Arrange - Action - Assertion Blocks
    * Mock - Moq
    * FluentAssertion
